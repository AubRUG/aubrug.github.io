<p>There is an abundance of tools and technologies for building applications to run on the internet. Most of them have desirable benefits, but also may take lots of time to learn. Which ones should you take the time to learn and become experienced? Ruby on Rails is a web application framework designed to build database backed web applications. It is especially desirable for developers and companies who want to quickly build web applications that can scale and evolve over time. In this presentation we'll learn how and why and even do some live coding and demos.</p>
