Most of them have desirable benefits, but also may take lots of time to learn. Which ones should you take the time to learn and become experienced? Ruby on Rails is a web application framework designed to build database backed web applications. It is especially desirable for developers and companies who want to quickly build web applications that can scale and evolve over time. In this presentation we'll learn how and why and even do some live coding and demos.\r\n\r\n##### About the speaker\r\n\r\nJess is a GSU alumni (2002, BBA in Finance). During college and the early 2000's, he started developing websites and web applications as a hobby, that later turned to side projects, and eventually starting a design and development consultancy in 2008. In 2010, Jess started learning Ruby on Rails and has been developing almost exclusively in rails since then. \r\n\r\n<http://www.brownwebdesign.com/about/jess-brown>\r\n\r\n##### Event Flyer\r\n\r\n[Download PDF.](https://github.com/AubRUG/flyers/blob/master/flyer.pdf?raw=true)\r\n\r\n### Contact\r\n\r\nThe Auburn Ruby User Group is being organized by [Steven Clontz](http://stevenclontz.com) (<steven.clontz@gmail.com>) and Sam Singer (<singess@auburn.edu>).
